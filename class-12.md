# Components
- EJS partials are useful when wanting to reuse HTML across various views
    - they help make websites easier to maintain by being able to change a re-usable bundle of code
- for example... Putting the navigation bar and the footer appear in different views
- the partial tag is <% ---- %>
    - allows us to output the *unescaped* content onto page (---)
