# Update / Delete
- client / server architecture: a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server using HTTP protocol

## Client-Side
- the `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent
    - two most important attributes are action and method
    - action --> defines where data gets sent
    - method --> defines how data is sent
        - this can be done through various methods, most common is *get* and *post*
- an HTTP request consists of *2* parts: the *header* which contains global metadata and a *body* that can contain information necessary for server to process request

## Get Method
- method used by browser to ask server to send back given resource, in any case it may send an empty body

## Post Method
- method the browser uses to talk to server when asking for a response that takes into account data provided by HTTP request
    - take a look at this data and send me back a result
